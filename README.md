# friend-finder

not fully functional

As of now the app simply accesses the home page and the survey. When the survey is submitted the info is stored in a variable which at this point is only shown via console.log.

still trying to get app to POST the survey input to the friends.js and process the data to find a best match to display on a modal pop-up.
